This app was developed as part of a college assignment. This app is a car buy amd sell app, For this assignment it is very basic layout
and does not look the best this will be implemented in part 2. There is persistance in the app using firebase. When you open the app 
you will see a list view showing the cars that are in the database. if you click on a list item it will open another activity that 
will basically display the information. on the top there is a button to add a car to the list you will not be able to add a car unless
all fields are filled in. when all fields are filled in you can click add and you will get a message notifying you if the car has been
 added to firebase. 
 
 # Presistence
 Firebase is added to this app for persistence you can close the app and open it and it will still have all the cars that are in the app
 and that have been added.
 
 # Github
 The project has been uploaded to github this is the link : https://github.com/CRea7/CarAppAndroid
 
 # UX/DX
 the UX in this app is very simple due to the implementation of firebase and having to change the UX will be updated inpart 2
 some basic data validation was added in the add activity so a user could not put in blank data.
